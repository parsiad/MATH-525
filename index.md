### Course description

This is a fairly rigorous introduction to probability theory with some emphasis given to both theory and applications, although a knowledge of measure theory is not assumed. Topics covered include probability spaces, conditional probability, independence, moment generating and characteristic functions, expectations, convergence of random variables, law of large numbers, central limit theorem, Markov chains, and Monte Carlo methods.

An archive of the course (including all lecture notes, assigments, solutions, TeX files, etc.) can be [downloaded directly](https://github.com/parsiad/MATH-525/archive/master.zip).

## Miscellany

You are not expected to know any material in this section for assignments/exams.

* Can the [principle of inclusion-exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle) be extended to countably many events? The answer seems to be yes, but with some technical conditions. See, e.g., [Friedland, Shmuel, and Elliot Krop. "Exact conditions for countable inclusion-exclusion identity and extensions."](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602035)
* [Why do probabilists take random variables to be Borel (and not Lebesgue) measurable?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/31603/why-do-probabilists-take-random-variables-to-be-borel-and-not-lebesgue-measura)
* [Is a measure for a sigma algebra determined by its values for a generator of the sigma algebra?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/90491/is-a-measure-for-a-sigma-algebra-determined-by-its-values-for-a-generator-of-the)
* A bound on the star discrepancy of the Van der Corput sequence can be found in [Haber, Seymour. "On a sequence of points of interest for numerical quadrature." J. Res. Nat. Bur. Standards Sect. B 70 (1966): 127-136](jresv70Bn2p127_A1b.pdf).

### Grading

The grading scheme is as follows:

* Assignments: 20%
* Midterms: 40%
* Final: 40%

Grades are posted on Canvas.

The lowest of your assignment scores will not count towards your final grade. Midterms will be held in class. The final is on **April 23rd, 1:30 - 3:30 pm in 296 Weiser Hall**. All exams are *closed book*.

The final exam covers all lectures except for lectures 21 and 22.

Alternate final times for students who cannot make the regular time are **April 25: 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm** and **April 27: 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**. Both alternate exams will be held in **2866 East Hall**.
